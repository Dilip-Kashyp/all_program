        <p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972
            and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix
            operating system.[8] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely
            used programming languages,[9][10] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer
            architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original
            language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language.[11][12] C has been
            standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

            C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and
            recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory
            and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
            Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A
            standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of
            computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.[13]
